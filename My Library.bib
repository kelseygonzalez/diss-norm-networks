		We leveraged exogenous variation in weather patterns across geographies to
		identify social contagion in exercise behaviours across a global social
		network. We estimated these contagion effects by combining daily global
		weather data, which creates exogenous variation in running among friends,
		with data on the network ties and daily exercise patterns of a 1/41.1M
		individuals who ran over 350M km in a global social network over 5 years.
		Here we show that exercise is socially contagious and that its contagiousness
		varies with the relative activity of and gender relationships between
		friends. Less active runners influence more active runners, but not the
		reverse. Both men and women influence men, while only women influence other
		women. While the Embeddedness and Structural Diversity theories of social
		contagion explain the influence effects we observe, the Complex Contagion
		theory does not. These results suggest interventions that account for social
		contagion will spread behaviour change more effectively.

		Despite tendencies toward convergence, differences between individuals and
		groups continue to exist in beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. An agent-based
		adaptive model reveals the effects of a mechanism of convergent social
		influence. The actors are placed at fixed sites. The basic premise is that
		the more similar an actor is to a neighbor, the more likely that that actor
		will adopt one of the neighbor's traits. Unlike previous models of social
		influence or cultural change that treat features one at a time, the proposed
		model takes into account the interaction between different features. The
		model illustrates how local convergence can generate global polarization.
		Simulations show that the number of stable homogeneous regions decreases with
		the number of features, increases with the number of alternative traits per
		feature, decreases with the range of interaction, and (most surprisingly)
		decreases when the geographic territory grows beyond a certain size.

		We show how data from online social networking services can help researchers

		network, with housing transaction data and explore both the structure and the
		effects of social networks. Individuals whose geographically distant friends
		experienced larger recent house price increases are more likely to transition
		from renting to owning. They also buy larger houses and pay more for a given
		house. Survey data show that these relationships are driven by the effects of
		social interactions on individuals' housing market expectations.

		We show that social network exposure to COVID-19 cases shapes individuals’
		beliefs and behaviors concerning the coronavirus. We use de-identified data
		from Facebook to document that individuals with friends in areas with worse
		COVID-19 outbreaks reduce their mobility more than otherwise similar
		individuals with friends in less affected areas. The effects are
		quantitatively large and long-lasting: a one standard deviation increase in
		friend-exposure to COVID-19 cases in March 2020 results in a 1.2 percentage
		point increase in the probability of staying home on a given day through at
		least the end of May 2020. As the pandemic progresses—and the characteristics
		of individuals with the highest friend-exposure vary— changes in
		friend-exposure continue to drive changes in social distancing behavior,
		ruling out many unobserved effects as drivers of our results. We also show
		that individuals with higher friend-exposure to COVID-19 are more likely to
		publicly post in support of social distancing measures and less likely to be
		members of groups advocating to "reopen" the economy. These findings suggest
		that friends can influence individuals’ beliefs about the risks of the
		disease and thereby induce them to engage in mitigating public health
		behavior.

		Network models of diffusion predominantly think about cultural variation as a
		product of social contagion. But culture does not spread like a virus. We
		propose an alternative explanation we call associative diffusion. Drawing on
		two insights from research in cognition?that meaning inheres in cognitive
		associations between concepts, and that perceived associations constrain
		people?s actions?we introduce a model in which, rather than beliefs or
		behaviors, the things being transmitted between individuals are perceptions
		about what beliefs or behaviors are compatible with one another. Conventional
		contagion models require the assumption that networks are segregated to
		explain cultural variation. We show, in contrast, that the endogenous
		emergence of cultural differentiation can be entirely attributable to social
		cognition and does not require a segregated network or a preexisting division
		into groups. Moreover, we show that prevailing assumptions about the effects
		of network topology do not hold when diffusion is associative.

		Objective: Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly
		recommends wearing masks or other protective face coverings in public to slow
		the spread of the coronavirus, the practice has been unevenly distributed in
		the United States. Methods: In this paper, we model county-level infrequent
		mask usage as a function of county-level Republican political leadership
		(percentage of votes for Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential election),
		conservative Protestantism (percentage evangelical Christian), and right-wing
		media consumption (interest in Fox News). Results: Our analyses show that
		counties with greater support for President Trump (especially in counties won
		by Trump), greater affiliation with evangelical Christianity, and greater
		interest in Fox News tend to exhibit higher rates of infrequent mask use.
		Conclusion: Given the effectiveness of masks in limiting the transmission of
		respiratory droplets, conservative ideological resistance to public health
		may indirectly support the acquisition and spread of the coronavirus.

		Voluntary physical distancing is essential for preventing the spread of
		COVID-19. We assessed the role of political partisanship in individuals’
		compliance with physical distancing recommendations of political leaders
		using data on mobility from a sample of mobile phones in 3,100 counties in
		the United States during March 2020, county-level partisan preferences,
		information about the political affiliation of state governors, and the
		timing of their communications about COVID-19 prevention. Regression analyses
		examined how political preferences influenced the association between
		governors’ COVID-19 communications and residents’ mobility patterns.
		Governors’ recommendations for residents to stay at home preceded
		stay-at-home orders and led to a significant reduction in mobility that was
		comparable to the effect of the orders themselves. Effects were larger in
		Democratic- than in Republican-leaning counties, a pattern more pronounced
		under Republican governors. Democratic-leaning counties also responded more
		strongly to recommendations from Republican than from Democratic governors.
		Political partisanship influences citizens’ decisions to voluntarily engage
		in physical distancing in response to communications by their governor.

		Social distancing is a key behavior to minimize COVID-19 infections.
		Identification of potentially modifiable determinants of social distancing
		behavior may provide essential evidence to inform social distancing
		behavioral interventions.The current study applied an integrated social
		cognition model to identify the determinants of social distancing behavior,
		and the processes involved, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.In a
		prospective correlational survey study, samples of Australian (N = 365) and
		U.S. (N = 440) residents completed online self-report measures of social
		cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, moral norm, anticipated
		regret, and perceived behavioral control [PBC]), intention, action planning,
		habit, and past behavior with respect to social distancing behavior at an
		initial occasion. Follow-up measures of habit and social distancing behavior
		were taken 1 week later.Structural equation models indicated that subjective
		norm, moral norm, and PBC were consistent predictors of intention in both
		samples. Intention, action planning, and habit at follow-up were consistent
		predictors of social distancing behavior in both samples. Action planning did
		not have consistent effects mediating or moderating the intention–behavior
		relationship. Inclusion of past behavior in the model attenuated effects
		among constructs, although the effects of the determinants of intention and
		behavior remained.Current findings highlight the importance of subjective
		norm, moral obligation, and PBC as determinants of social distancing
		intention and intention and habit as behavioral determinants. Future research
		on long-range predictors of social distancing behavior and reciprocal effects
		in the integrated model is warranted.

		Objectives: We test whether the association between state religiosity and
		distance travelled is moderated by population age during the novel
		coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Mobility is operationalized as the
		state-level average median distance traveled from February 24 to May 4 across
		the contiguous United States. Shelter-in-place rates are operationalized as
		the state-level percentage of users staying home. State religiosity is
		measured with an index of aggregated religious identities, beliefs, and
		practices. Population age is indicated by the state percentage of adults aged
		65 and older. We model population mobility using regression with state
		clustered robust standard errors. Results: We observe that religious states
		tend to travel more during the early stages of the pandemic. However, the
		behavioral risks associated with state religiosity are less pronounced in
		states with larger elderly populations. Discussion: We contribute to our
		understanding of the social patterning of pandemic mobility in aging
		populations.

		Norms are a foundational concept in sociology. Following a period of

		have seen a proliferation of norms research across the social sciences. Here
		we focus on the burgeoning research in sociology to answer questions about
		where norms come from, why people enforce them, and how they are applied. To
		do so, we rely on three key theoretical approaches in the
		literature—consequentialist, relational, and agentic. As we apply these
		approaches, we explore their implications for what are arguably the two most
		fundamental issues in sociology—social order and inequality. We conclude by
		synthesizing and building on existing norms research to produce an integrated
		theoretical framework that can shed light on aspects of norms that are
		currently not well understood—in particular, their change and erosion.

		Donald Trump is the first U.S. President to be on the record as having
		anti-vaccination attitudes. Given his enormous reach and influence, it is
		worthwhile examining the extent to which allegiance to Trump is associated
		with the public's perceptions of vaccine safety and efficacy. In both Study 1
		(N~=~518) and Study 2 (N~=~316), Trump voters were significantly more
		concerned about vaccines than other Americans. This tendency was reduced to
		non-significance after controlling for conspiracist ideation (i.e., general
		willingness to believe conspiracy theories) and, to a lesser degree,
		political conservatism. In Study 2, participants were later exposed to real
		Trump tweets that either focused on his anti-vaccination views, or focused on
		golf (the control condition). Compared to when the same respondents were
		sampled a week earlier, there was a significant increase in vaccine concern,
		but only among Trump voters who were exposed to the anti-vaccination tweets.
		The effects were exclusively negative: there was no evidence that
		anti-vaccination Trump tweets polarized liberal voters into becoming more
		pro-vaccination. In line with the social identity model of leadership, Study
		2 indicates that some leaders do not simply represent the attitudes and
		opinions of the group, but can also change group members' opinions.

		This paper is the first to examine the role of the cultural dimension in

		Google COVID-19 community mobility reports and the Hofstede cultural factors
		for 58 countries over the period from 16 February to 29 March 2020, we find
		that countries with higher ‘Uncertainty Avoidance Index’ predict the lower
		proportion of people gathering in public such as retail and recreation,
		grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces. However, we do not
		find any predictive factor in having a relationship with the percentage of
		citizens staying in their residential areas. Our results are robust by adding
		the control variable as the wealth status, GDP per capita. Hence, this paper
		suggests some effective communications to contain the COVID-19 pandemic by
		emphasizing the role of uncertainties.

		Distrust in scientific expertise1–14 is dangerous. Opposition to vaccination
		with a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, for
		example, could amplify outbreaks2–4, as happened for measles in 20195,6.
		Homemade remedies7,8 and falsehoods are being shared widely on the Internet,
		as well as dismissals of expert advice9–11. There is a lack of understanding
		about how this distrust evolves at the system level13,14. Here we provide a
		map of the contention surrounding vaccines that has emerged from the global
		pool of around three billion Facebook users. Its core reveals a multi-sided
		landscape of unprecedented intricacy that involves nearly 100~million
		individuals partitioned into highly dynamic, interconnected clusters across
		cities, countries, continents and languages. Although smaller in overall
		size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with
		undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination
		clusters are more peripheral. Our theoretical framework reproduces the recent
		explosive growth in anti-vaccination views, and predicts that these views
		will dominate in a decade. Insights provided by this framework can inform new
		policies and approaches to interrupt this shift to negative views. Our
		results challenge the conventional thinking about undecided individuals in
		issues of contention surrounding health, shed light on other issues of
		contention such as climate change11, and highlight the key role of network
		cluster dynamics in multi-species ecologies15.

		Models of behavioral diffusion typically deal with binary states such as
		adopting a practice or technology, spreading a rumor, or participating in a
		protest. If our aim is to promote (or inhibit) diffusion of a particular
		behavior, we should have a deep understanding of the social context and clear
		guidance for how to use that understanding to design effective influence
		campaigns. In this project, we contribute to the development of a general
		framework that will allow users to diagnose a situation and identify potent
		levers for influence according to the best available research. This framework
		should then inform the development of a coherent influence (or
		counter-influence) strategy, including specific tactics and their sequence,
		timing, and location. To be effective, such a framework should be both
		general and parsimonious -- integrating strands of research in social
		psychology, organizational behavior, and network science -- but also concrete
		enough to translate into empirical interventions. This paper is a first step
		toward producing such a framework.

		Recent work argued that researchers conceptualize 'social ties' in four
		fundamentally different ways-as socially constructed role relations such as
		friendship or co-authorship; sentiments such as liking or hatred;
		interactions such as communication or sex; and access to resources or
		opportunities. We consider where ties (and non-ties) are likely to correspond

		on one network concept (e.g., sentiment ties of liking and disliking) to data
		representing another (e.g., interaction as logs of phone calls). Then we
		discuss empirical lenses emerging from computational social science, such as
		location-aware devices, electronic calendars, wearable sensors, records of
		electronic messages, phone calls, or online transactions. We ask how these
		time-stamped event series correspond to the conventional network concepts
		above and call for a new analytical approach: Directly theorizing and
		analyzing the structural-temporal interdependencies of interaction events
		redirects our attention from structural patterns to social processes.

		How does network structure influence opinion? Relying on theories of

		random network), individuals' connections tend not to be connected, instead

		exposure to underdog views, compared with the clustered lattice. Individuals

		uninvolving issues (e.g., "Choose a color: red or blue."). Ss were organized
		into 36 groups of 24 people each, and discussed between 4 and 10 conformity

		majority, Ss' choices resulted in the emergence of 4 forms of group-level

		became more similar to their neighbors in electronic space, opinions on
		originally unrelated topics became correlated, and majority factions
		increased in size, but minorities, protected by the emergence of coherent
		subgroups, did not completely disappear. The authors discuss the nature of
		social space in computer networks and draw applications of DSI theory for

		Disentangling the effects of selection and influence is one of social
		science's greatest unsolved puzzles: Do people befriend others who are
		similar to them, or do they become more similar to their friends over time?
		Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with
		self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to
		address this question with a greater degree of precision than has heretofore
		been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a cohort of college
		students over 4 years, we find that students who share certain tastes in
		music and in movies, but not in books, are significantly likely to befriend
		one another. Meanwhile, we find little evidence for the diffusion of tastes
		among Facebook friends—except for tastes in classical/jazz music. These
		findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for observed network
		homogeneity; provide a statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution
		of cultural tastes and social relationships; and suggest important
		qualifications to our understanding of both homophily and contagion as
		generic social processes.

		This study explores the relationship structure of cultural rejection. The
		proposition is advanced that people reject cultural practices as the proxies
		of out-groups who are perceived to be associated with them, so that they
		would maintain social identities that are separate from those of out-groups.
		Using data on musical preferences from 1993 General Social Survey, it applies
		blockmodeling—a methodology originally developed in social network
		analysis—in a new way to analyze the structure of cultural rejection within
		U.S. society. The results indicate that blockmodeling based on cultural
		rejection is effective in uncovering sociologically meaningful positions
		among the respondents. The results are mostly consistent with the omnivore
		thesis, while highlighting the multifaceted nature of cultural divisions in
		the United States. Finally, the identified positions correspond with
		respondents’ perception of the degree of unity (or lack thereof) among
		Americans, consistent with the theoretical assumption of this study.

		Objectives Social perceptions in areas such as family life, economy,
		education, health, and energy can be uncertain and difficult to measure. This
		article proposes a well-defined methodology to measure social perceptions by
		observing individuals’ Google searches for online content with the support of
		three free tools: Google Trends, Keyword Planner, and Related Searches.
		Methods The proposed methodology is a step-by-step process that identifies
		representative keywords for prevailing social perceptions, and then
		aggregates them into specialized descriptive indexes, which are designed to
		highlight changes in search trends over time. Results To exemplify the
		process, the methodology is applied to measure changes in economic and social
		perceptions in Chile during 2004–2014. Results show that, over these years,
		Chileans moved from a pro-business view to a largely anti-business
		perspective based on issues such as lucre, inequality, and abuses.
		Conclusions The methodology works well, as we are able to identify in two
		complementary ways the moment at which Chilean citizens moved from one
		perspective to another. The application of this methodology to Mexico, Peru,
		and Colombia also provided satisfactory results.

		Background Influenza vaccine hesitancy is a significant threat to global
		efforts to reduce the burden of seasonal and pandemic influenza. Potential
		barriers of influenza vaccination need to be identified to inform
		interventions to raise awareness, influenza vaccine acceptance and uptake.
		Objective This review aims to (1) identify relevant studies and extract
		individual barriers of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination for risk
		groups and the general public; and (2) map knowledge gaps in understanding
		influenza vaccine hesitancy to derive directions for further research and
		inform interventions in this area. Methods Thirteen databases covering the
		areas of Medicine, Bioscience, Psychology, Sociology and Public Health were
		searched for peer-reviewed articles published between the years 2005 and
		2016. Following the PRISMA approach, 470 articles were selected and analyzed
		for significant barriers to influenza vaccine uptake or intention. The
		barriers for different risk groups and flu types were clustered according to
		a conceptual framework based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and discussed
		using the 4C model of reasons for non-vaccination. Results Most studies were
		conducted in the American and European region. Health care personnel (HCP)
		and the general public were the most studied populations, while parental
		decisions for children at high risk were under-represented. This study also
		identifies understudied concepts. A lack of confidence, inconvenience,
		calculation and complacency were identified to different extents as barriers
		to influenza vaccine uptake in risk groups. Conclusion Many different
		psychological, contextual, sociodemographic and physical barriers that are
		specific to certain risk groups were identified. While most sociodemographic
		and physical variables may be significantly related to influenza vaccine
		hesitancy, they cannot be used to explain its emergence or intensity.
		Psychological determinants were meaningfully related to uptake and should
		therefore be measured in a valid and comparable way. A compendium of
		measurements for future use is suggested as supporting information.

		Perceptions of the behavior of those around us provide important cues as to
		what our own behavior should be. However, we know relatively little about the
		source of these perceptions and how they develop in the course of
		interaction. This article provides a conceptual framework for the
		relationship between social network structure and perceptions of descriptive
		social norms—what other people in a group tend to do. Because networks
		represent (1) whom group members are exposed to, (2) the amount of exposure
		group members have to others, and (3) the type of exposure group members have
		to others, they shape individuals' perceptions of descriptive social norms.
		The article uses original data from a vegetarian co-op on a university campus
		as an empirical example of how networks inform perceptions of norms in a
		group. The evidence demonstrates the utility of a network-based approach to
		understanding the formation and change of social norms and the accuracy of
		perceptions of the behavior of others. I argue that the process by which
		individuals make inferences about group norms differs based on the type of
		behavior under consideration and the type of relationship between
		individuals.
