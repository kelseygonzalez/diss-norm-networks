# Dissertation Appendix 3: Social Norms under Uncertain Times: A dynamic study of Stay-At-Home and Vaccination Rates During the COVID-19 Pandemic

My final article takes a deeper dive into the formation of social norms governing health behaviors in cases of 
extreme uncertainty using the cases of both stay-at- home rates and vaccination rates as responses to public 
health recommendations to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Using theories like associative diffusion and the 
integrated theoretical framework of norms, I test models of behavioral adaption to public health recommendations
and patterns of complex contagion (the need for repeated exposures to something novel for it to diffuse) using
linear mixed effects models. These models show that complex contagion is a valid framework for the social
contagion of new norms during COVID-19. Importantly, I find a novel mod- erating effect of signal discordance,
the contextual diversity of signals received by an ego. If there is diversity in the information received by an
ego, contagion is less likely to occur. This paper shows that the contagion process cannot be fully understood
without looking at the context of each exposure to a contagion within the range of contagions one experiences.
